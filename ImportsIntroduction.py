#Write a program which simulates flipping a coin.
# The user should be able to enter the number of “coin flips” they require at the start,
# with the program outputting a list of each flip, followed by the total number.
# For example, of the user inputs 5, the output may look something like:
# Heads
# Heads
# Tails
# Heads
# Tails
# Total Heads: 3
# Total Tails: 2
